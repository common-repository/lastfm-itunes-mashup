== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this without widgets enabled? =

Version 0.5 has standard sidebar support in the roadmap, until then, unfortunately not.

= I can see two tabs on the widget, but the links take me to my last.fm profile, not the named panel? =

Adding the javascript panel switcher is pencilled in for 0.2, for now, please only enable one of the panels in the admin panel
